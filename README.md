# Form Validation with Regular Expressions in JavaScript (OOP Approach)

## 📌 Overview
This project provides a **form validation system** using **JavaScript** with an **object-oriented approach (OOP)**. It uses **regular expressions (RegEx)** to validate user inputs dynamically, ensuring data integrity and a smooth user experience.

## ✨ Features
- Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) design for scalability.
- Regular Expressions (RegEx) for validating:
  - ✅ Username (Alphanumeric, 5-20 characters)
  - ✅ Email (Valid email format)
  - ✅ Password (At least 8 characters, including letters & numbers)
  - ✅ Phone Number (10-digit numeric)
- Inline error messages for better UX.
- Prevents form submission on invalid input.

## 🚀 How It Works
1. The **`FormValidator`** class initializes with the form ID.
2. Event listeners detect form submission.
3. Each input field is validated against predefined **RegEx patterns**.
4. Errors are displayed dynamically, and submission is blocked until all fields are valid.
